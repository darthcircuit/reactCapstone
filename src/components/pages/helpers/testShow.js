Abe's parents, the rule-bending Amish matron Mary and the strictly religious Chester, serve as their hosts. Mary and Chester have struggles of their own that put them in a precarious situation. Their daughter Katie Ann has a big decision to make, and their son Andrew, just out of jail, adds fuel to the fire by bringing his opinionated English girlfriend, Chapel, back home with him. Sabrina and Rebecca are both expecting babies, Kate is anxiously awaiting the career opportunity of a lifetime, Abe and Andrew's sibling rivalry is reignited through new clashes, and Jeremiah must put it all on the line to find happiness.</p>",
